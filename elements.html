								<h2>What keeps me going <br />
								</h2>
								<h3>Curiosity, Spirituality, Sustainability <br />
								</h3>
							</header>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/Meditation.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p>Curiosity: I have always been deeply intrigued by the inner workings of the world around me. My decision to pursue a career in science and engineering stems from a profound desire to unravel the mysteries that captivate my curiosity. The sensation of not fully comprehending something leaves me restless, compelling me to persist until I gain a comprehensive understanding.</p>
							<p>Spirituality: My quest for truth extends beyond the material world; it delves into the metaphysical realms. I consistently find myself pondering questions such as the nature of consciousness, the purpose of the universe, and the existence of anything beyond what we perceive as our reality. In my pursuit of answers to these profound inquiries, I turn to Indic scriptures. I resonate with the philosophy of "Advaita," which fundamentally asserts that there is no inherent duality in anything that exists. According to this philosophy, differences are merely perceptions of consciousness, whether observed in the dimensions of time or space.</p>
							<p>Sustainability: Viewing consciousness as an indivisible unit, I inherently care about all life on our planet. Simultaneously, I am a proponent of expanding consciousness, transcending Earth's boundaries in both physical and artificial forms. Thus, I envision myself as a facilitator, broadening the horizons of human reach while safeguarding the tiniest manifestations of consciousness through technology. This dual commitment to the well-being of our planet and the exploration of new frontiers encapsulates my dedication to a sustainable and expansive future.</p>

								<h2>Beyond Work <br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/Hobby.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p>I have always enjoyed physical activity. Until high school, I used to play soccer, and since college, I have been working out consistently. I deeply believe that health is the primary wealth.</p>
							<p>I am passionate about all types of music, spanning from Indian classical raags to Western symphonies, and from Indie folk to hip-hop. However, my favorite genre is Rock, with Linkin Park and Coldplay standing out as my all-time favorite artists. I have also taken piano/keyboard classes for 1.5 years. Currently, I am out of touch due to time constraints, but I certainly want to resume learning as soon as possible.</p>
